# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 19: June 29, Monday

**Today's Progress** Today I continued working on an application that would allow administrative function to my company's SaaS software. Also did some training with fellow devs on Git Flow. Learned about GitHub Issues and configured them for our Team's use. 

**Thoughts** It was a lot of fun teaching my fellow teammates on how to submit code for our projects. It is really starting to come together and I am excited to see what we are capable of doing here in the next few months.

### Day 18: June 26, Friday

**Today's Progress** Today I started working on an application that would allow administrative function to my company's SaaS software.  

**Thoughts** The fact that the functionality doesn't already exist is kind of bewildering. But it gave me a chance to tackle a rather difficult feature.

### Day 17: June 25, Thursday

**Today's Progress** Today I worked on finalizing a work project, designing an application for our SaaS software. 

**Thoughts** Working inside an SDK designed specific for a piece of software can be challenging. Luckily there is excellent documentation available.

### Day 16: June 24, Wednesday

**Today's Progress** Today I worked on FCC Survey Form. Was able to add all the remaining elements and pass all the tests. Next step will be to start styling the form. Going to try to do this with plain CSS.

**Thoughts** I realize how important it is to do this exercise using only the foundations of HTML and CSS but I so want to use some styling libraries to make this look good. Will have to resist that temptation as I work to cement my knowledge of the basics.

### Day 15: June 23, Tuesday

**Today's Progress** Today I worked on using installation parameters that will allow for the collection of sensitive data when installing an application. In this case it was to allow for the collection of an api key and then allow us access to that key when sending post requests.

**Thoughts** Had hoped to do further coding today. Perhaps work on another project but I was not able to do so. However, tomorrow is another day.

### Day 14: June 22, Monday

**Today's Progress** Today I built a Blog Application using Node.js, Express, MongoDB and EJS. It required a few more libraries as well but was a great learning experience. Dealing with routes and views is difficult but no other way to learn but by doing.

**Thoughts** This was an awesome way to get exposure to how to write server side code, allowing for the implementation of routes. It also helped me to realize that there are a lot of little things that you have to be aware of for production style code. Like sanitizing your html and preventing people from being able to cross-site script in your application. All in all it was fun to build.

### Day 13: June 17, Wednesday

**Today's Progress** Today I worked on solving a few code katas. Cemented the Git Flow experience for our development team. Configured GitHub for branch protection and reviewed a few pull requests.
 
**Thoughts** It is so cool to witness the Git Flow process. Pull requests, merging branches, code reviews. Makes the fact of becoming a developer seem so real.

### Day 12: June 16, Tuesday

**Today's Progress** Today, was a great day. Our team had our first Zoom meeting. Was awesome getting to see everyone and introduce ourselves. We also discussed our first project, a team website. Once that was determined we started creating a backlog of issues, getting ready for our first sprint. I ended the day doing some code katas, which allowed me to spend some time coding. Worked on linking Javascript methods to refactor and shorten code.
 
**Thoughts** I can't wait to see what happens with this first project our team is working on. We are working to incorporate all aspects of development to better prepare ourselves for the workplace. Add to that the challenges of working remotely and across the globe.

### Day 11: June 15, Monday

**Today's Progress** Today, I spent time working in our team's slack channel adding content that would help offer resources for those looking for web development tools. I also did some further study on the Agile Method in preparation for our team's first meeting. Did write much code today, but did focus on software development culture.
 
**Thoughts** I wish I had worked on a project or two. Just write some code. But work was busy and I really wanted to be prepared for our team's first meeting. So my focus was on that. There will be many more days of writing code. The goal is to remain focused.

### Day 10: June 14, Sunday

**Today's Progress** Today, Again I worked on a code kata using javascript string manipulation. This time was focused on creating a method that would work on String.prototype. The "This" Keyword was introduced to solve this problem.
 
**Thoughts** Was a great day for Team Armadillo as we were introduced to our Team's Logo. One step closer to starting our first project.

### Day 9: June 13, Saturday

**Today's Progress** Today, I worked on a code kata using javascript string manipulation. Usecase was to take a persons name as a string and return only their first and last initial. Stumbled into the answer and had a fellow dev refactor the code for me. Also our development team took a big step forward today and decided on a team name. Go Team Armadillo!!
 
**Thoughts** Really excited to start planning our team's first project. There are a number of great ideas. Our goal is to grow as developers while learning what it is like to be part of a software development team in the workplace. Utilizing all the professional development tools. Lots to learn, that is for sure.

### Day 8: June 12, Friday

**Today's Progress** Today, taught a fellow coder how to use git and github, worked on researching how to implement Git Flow. Also worked on some code katas. Stuck trying to figure out how to pass an object into a javascript function.
 
**Thoughts** Frustrated that I struggled so much with passing an object into a function. The concept makes sense to me but I struggled figuring out the syntax. Will tackle again tomorrow. However, enjoyed being able to teach someone on how to use git and github. Their reaction when they were able to get it to work is so rewarding.

### Day 7: June 11, Thursday

**Today's Progress** Today, we advanced in building our development team by adding 5 more members. Worked on creating a repo to submit possible team names. Also worked with VS Code Live Share with a teammate to work on some collaboration tools. We worked a Codewars Code Kata together.
 
**Thoughts** It was a great day. We were really able to make some headway with organizing our dev team. Looking forward to working with these guys. Anxious to see what we can come up with.

### Day 6: June 10, Wednesday

**Today's Progress** Today was the start of a new development team. Discussed some career goals, talked about Software as a Service, and taught about The Agile Method. Introduced Trello into our project management toolbox. 

Today I didn't write much code. However I did make a few tweaks on an app I developed for my workplace. Required using a little jQuery to grab an html element and attach a value to it. 

**Thoughts** The 100DaysOfCode community led me to meet a really cool dude. We have joined up to start a development team that will begin the planning stages of a project. Not sure what yet...

### Day 5: June 09, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Today I created a RESTful Todo List API using node.js and MongoDB. Using CRUD methods I am able to add tasks that need completed to a database. I am thinking of tying in a frontend application to create the tasks. 

**Thoughts** After working through these tutorials to learn new concepts, I am struggling with the retention percentage. The over-arching concepts make sense to me but when I try to recreate these apps, I struggle to do so. Starting to realize that being a developer requires a level of acceptance and patience.

### Day 4: June 08, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Today was a rough day. I took a step back from FreeCodeCamp projects to deploy my slackbot to MS Azure. This was a real struggle but was finally able to get it live. No I am struggling to replicate the scenario, something to do with the Slack API. 

**Thoughts** It shouldn't be this hard to simply create an application and publish to production but it just doesn't seem to want to function as it should. This leads to frustration. But I know that I will figure it out, I just have to stick with it. Tomorrow is another day.

### Day 3: June 07, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Today I finished up the first FreeCodeCamp web design project and started the second one. I setup my file structure and begin the design layout in Adobe XD. Set the project up in Trello. Trying to do these as if they were assigned in the real workplace environment. 

**Thoughts** This is a great project but, again, I still want to use some libraries like bootstrap. It makes design work so much easier. But since I have identified design as a weakness, I should stay away from the easy road and work to develop this skill.

### Day 2: June 06, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Today I started working my way through the FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Projects. First project in the line-up is a Tribute Page. Picked Steve Yzerman, and began the layout of the page using HTML and CSS. I also created a Trello Board for my 100DaysOfCode journey. 

**Thoughts** These projects are a great place to start to add some content to my resume. But the truth is I am not much of a designer. I much prefer creating applications that use functional programming. But I really need to work on just the basics for a little while.

### Day 1: June 05, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Today I completed my App for the Freshworks co<div> Hackathon. It is a MS OneNote - Freshservice Integration application.

**Thoughts** This was an amazing experience. I was concerned that I wasn't going to have enough time to finish the project. But with 45 minutes to spare, I finally was able to get the app to work. Submitted my project and called it a day.
