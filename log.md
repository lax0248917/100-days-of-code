# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 6: June 12, Friday

**Today's Progress** Today, taught a fellow coder how to use git and github, worked on researching how to implement Git Flow. Also worked on some code katas. Stuck trying to figure out how to pass an object into a javascript function.
 
**Thoughts** Frustrated that I struggled so much with passing an object into a function. The concept makes sense to me but I struggled figuring out the syntax. Will tackle again tomorrow. However, enjoyed being able to teach someone on how to use git and github. Their reaction when they were able to get it to work is so rewarding.

### Day 7: June 11, Thursday

**Today's Progress** Today, we advanced in building our development team by adding 5 more members. Worked on creating a repo to submit possible team names. Also worked with VS Code Live Share with a teammate to work on some collaboration tools. We worked a Codewars Code Kata together.
 
**Thoughts** It was a great day. We were really able to make some headway with organizing our dev team. Looking forward to working with these guys. Anxious to see what we can come up with.

### Day 6: June 10, Wednesday

**Today's Progress** Today was the start of a new development team. Discussed some career goals, talked about Software as a Service, and taught about The Agile Method. Introduced Trello into our project management toolbox. 

Today I didn't write much code. However I did make a few tweaks on an app I developed for my workplace. Required using a little jQuery to grab an html element and attach a value to it. 

**Thoughts** The 100DaysOfCode community led me to meet a really cool dude. We have joined up to start a development team that will begin the planning stages of a project. Not sure what yet...

### Day 5: June 09, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Today I created a RESTful Todo List API using node.js and MongoDB. Using CRUD methods I am able to add tasks that need completed to a database. I am thinking of tying in a frontend application to create the tasks. 

**Thoughts** After working through these tutorials to learn new concepts, I am struggling with the retention percentage. The over-arching concepts make sense to me but when I try to recreate these apps, I struggle to do so. Starting to realize that being a developer requires a level of acceptance and patience.

### Day 4: June 08, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Today was a rough day. I took a step back from FreeCodeCamp projects to deploy my slackbot to MS Azure. This was a real struggle but was finally able to get it live. No I am struggling to replicate the scenario, something to do with the Slack API. 

**Thoughts** It shouldn't be this hard to simply create an application and publish to production but it just doesn't seem to want to function as it should. This leads to frustration. But I know that I will figure it out, I just have to stick with it. Tomorrow is another day.

### Day 3: June 07, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Today I finished up the first FreeCodeCamp web design project and started the second one. I setup my file structure and begin the design layout in Adobe XD. Set the project up in Trello. Trying to do these as if they were assigned in the real workplace environment. 

**Thoughts** This is a great project but, again, I still want to use some libraries like bootstrap. It makes design work so much easier. But since I have identified design as a weakness, I should stay away from the easy road and work to develop this skill.

### Day 2: June 06, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Today I started working my way through the FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Projects. First project in the line-up is a Tribute Page. Picked Steve Yzerman, and began the layout of the page using HTML and CSS. I also created a Trello Board for my 100DaysOfCode journey. 

**Thoughts** These projects are a great place to start to add some content to my resume. But the truth is I am not much of a designer. I much prefer creating applications that use functional programming. But I really need to work on just the basics for a little while.

### Day 1: June 05, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Today I completed my App for the Freshworks co<div> Hackathon. It is a MS OneNote - Freshservice Integration application.

**Thoughts** This was an amazing experience. I was concerned that I wasn't going to have enough time to finish the project. But with 45 minutes to spare, I finally was able to get the app to work. Submitted my project and called it a day.
